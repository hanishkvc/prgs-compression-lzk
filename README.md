# Simple and potentially Stupid LZ compression quick experiment/exploration

This a simple and potentially stupid lz / dictionary based compression
experimentation / exploration. Done to check it out for fun, sometime
back.

This simple README added for github upload. Look at the git
log for actual details. Same with comment in code, it is
not up-to-date, the code commits and the git log associated
with it has better info / details.
